The goal is to predict the market value of a football player based on his characteristics. The dataset consists of 2000 players.

In 1_explore we explore the data and perform some cleaning, and in 2_predict we train several models and evaluate them.

In 3_pipeline_run we implement a more rigourous approach where we deploy a pipeline to train various models.
